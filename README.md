# quicksort
A C and assembly implementation of quicksort

# Compiling
Be sure that nasm and libc6-dev-i386 is correctly installed. If not, run

	$ sudo apt-get install nasm
	$ sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386

in Ubuntu, or the corresponding code in your operating system's package manager. 
Next, run
  
	$ make

# future improvement
The intention is to add capability to have a list of words from the standard input be sorted,
using the quicksort algorithm implemented in assembly.  Watch this space.. although you may watch
for some time still

# remarks
This project once again is for the fun of it.  I was taught in Java initially and only later learned
C and Assembly.  This project serves the purpose of gaining experience in C and Assembly.
